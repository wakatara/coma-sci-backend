                   The Asteroid Orbital Elements Database

Introduction astorb.dat is an ASCII file of high-precision osculating
orbital elements, ephemeris uncertainties, and some additional data for all
the numbered asteroids and the vast majority of unnumbered asteroids
(multi-apparition and single-apparition) for which it is possible to make
reasonably determinate computations. It is currently about 29.6 Mb in size
in its compressed form (astorb.dat.gz), 108.4 Mb in size when decompressed
(astorb.dat), and contains 404532 orbits computed by me (Edward Bowell).
Each orbit, based on astrometric observations downloaded from the Minor
Planet Center, occupies one 266-column record.

Special Features of astorb.dat There are three primary differences between
our database and conventional asteroid orbit files.

First, we update the database daily. Thus, observations in each new batch of
Minor Planet Circulars will be used in new orbits on a monthly basis, and
those in the Minor Planet Electronic Circulars shortly after they are
published. Other changes, such as the addition of orbits resulting from our
own astrometric observations and the computation of current ephemeris
uncertainties, are being made on a quasi-daily basis. Automatic daily
updates commence at 8 hr UT. The updating process is generally completed by
10:00 UT. On the UT date of full Moon, the updating process is not completed
until 14 hr UT or later.

Second, all the orbits in a given version of the file have an epoch of
osculation near the present. Consequently, the ephemerides of most
non-Earth-approaching asteroids can be computed to arcsec accuracy or better
within ± 50 days of the epoch using a 2-body ephemeris program.

Third, current and future ephemeris uncertainties are given. Observers will
readily be able to estimate whether asteroids are likely to be within their
telescopes' fields of view, and they will better be able to prioritize
astrometric targets.

Downloading astorb.dat The file may be obtained by the following means:

   * Get a decompressed version (astorb.dat) via ftp by clicking on here.
     The source (astorb.dat.gz) is compressed but your browser should
     automatically decompress it. If this fails, try getting the original,
     uncompressed version by clicking here. And if this fails, try ftp'ing
     astorb.dat to yourself using the recipe below (except type "get
     astorb.dat" rather than "get astorb.dat.gz"). To name the file on a
     Netscape browser, click on "File", then on "Save as", then on "OK" (the
     file will automatically be named astorb.dat unless you choose another
     name at this point).

   * If the above doesn't work or if you know someone who would like
     astorb.dat and has ftp but not WWW access, note that the compressed
     version is available via anonymous ftp at
     ftp.lowell.edu/pub/elgb/astorb.dat.gz, as are text versions (astorb.txt
     and astorb_landmarks.txt) of astorb.html and astorb_landmarks.html.
     Type the following commands:

     ftp ftp.lowell.edu
     Name: anonymous
     Password: your email address
     ftp>cd pub/elgb
     ftp>get astorb.txt
     ftp>get astorb_landmarks.txt
     ftp>get astorb.dat.gz
     ftp>quit

     astorb.dat.gz has been compressed using a public-domain utility called
     gzip. To decompress the file (which will result in file astorb.dat),
     type
     gunzip astorb.dat.gz

        o gzip code is available at prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.tar
          (UNIX version) and prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.msdos.exe
          (DOS version). The gzip software accommodates both the gzip and
          the gunzip commands.

          Type the following commands:

          ftp prep.ai.mit.edu
          Name: anonymous
          Password: your email address
          ftp>cd pub/gnu
          ftp>get gzip-1.2.3.tar (or get gzip-1.2.4.msdos.exe)
          ftp>quit

   * Tell your colleagues lacking both web and ftp access that we can supply
     them with a compressed copy of the file along with the decompression
     software, preferably on 3.5-in (9-cm) diskettes, in either UNIX or DOS
     format. To arrange delivery, email us at koehn@lowell.edu or call Bruce
     Koehn at +1-520-774-3358 (fax +1-520-774-6296), specifying the medium
     and format you prefer.

Incremental update files In response to users who have difficulty
downloading the complete astorb.dat (see above for instructions), we have
instituted (9 October 1996) a method of logging daily changes in the orbital
elements therein. Users will find files such as yymmdd.add and yymmdd.del in
our public ftp area accessible from the WWW. These cover update activities
for the past 30 days or more. Thus, 961007.add comprises records for
asteroids whose orbital elements were either added to or replaced in
astorb.dat on 7 October 1996; and 960930.del contains records for asteroids
whose orbits were deleted from astorb.dat on 30 September 1996. Note the
following: (1) The *.add files are refreshed every day. Thus, an orbit that
was replaced on, say, 961001 and then again on 961002 will be found only in
the 961002.add file on or after the latter date. (2) The *.add files reflect
changes in orbital elements only. Changes to other parameters (such as H, G,
and integer codes), as well as daily updates of ephemeris uncertainties, are
not reported in the *.add files. Users who are interested in the latter
should download the entire astorb.dat. To download the *.add and *.del
files, add the commands

ftp>mget *.add
ftp>mget *.del

to the ftp instructions above.

Note that some numerical data (e.g., asteroid number) are encoded as
character variables. You may need to decode them.

Parameters are:

 Parameter                           Description
       (1)Asteroid number (blank if unnumbered).

          "Asteroids II", R. P. Binzel et al. (eds.), The University of
          Arizona Press, Tucson, 1989 and more recent Minor Planet
       (4)Circulars]. Note that H may be given to 2 decimal places (e.g.,
          13.41), 1 decimal place (13.4) or as an integer (13), depending
          on its estimated accuracy. H is given to two decimal places for
          all unnumbered asteroids, even though it may be very poorly
          known.

          intervals on or after Julian dates ending in 50.5 (19980328,

          Greatest PEU, arcsec, in 10 years from date of next PEU, and date
          of its occurrence, yyyymmdd, if two observations (of accuracy
      (25)equal to that of the observations currently included in the
          orbit--typically ± 1 arcsec) were to be made on the date of the
          next PEU [parameter (23)].

The meanings of the six integer codes [parameter (9)] are as follows
(reference to "type 6:7", for example, means code 6, value 7):

Notes on File Content

*Osculating elements [parameters (13) through (18)] are heliocentric.

*It may be assumed that ephemeris uncertainties are along the line of
variation. Except for very accurately known orbits (ephemeris uncertainty <
1 arcsec) and very poorly known orbits (arc < 10 days), positional
uncertainty perpendicular to the line of variation is usually very small
compared to that along the line of variation.

*The current ephemeris uncertainty [CEU, parameter (20)] and its rate of
change [parameter (21)] indicate whether an asteroid ought to be located in
an observer's field of view. A CEU greater than all three of the peak
ephemeris uncertainties [PEUs, parameters (23) through (25)] implies that
the asteroid's ephemeris uncertainty is currently greater than at any time
in the next ten years. Such asteroids are prime targets for observation
because their orbits are subject to the greatest improvement for years to
come. Note that, because ephemeris uncertainties have been computed using
2-body rather than n-body error propagation (see K. Muinonen and E. Bowell,
Icarus 104, 255-279, 1993), uncertainties for Earth-approaching asteroids
may have been misestimated by a factor of several.

*Most single-apparition asteroids are hopelessly lost. They have large
CEUs--typically ± 105 to ± 106 arcsec. CEUs may have been imperfectly
computed for such asteroids (though it should hardly matter) because of
poorly known or unknown observational accuracy and/or because orbital
eccentricities have been assumed (integer code 2 equals 2 or 4; see the
integer-code table above). Users who wish to estimate ephemeris
uncertainties for lost asteroids at times close to when they were observed
may make use of the approximate formulae (formulae require Netscape Version
2.0 or higher for proper rendering):

   [sigma](t) = ±4500(q - 1) (tf - t) / [tarc2 (N - 3)1/2 [Delta]] arcsec

  [sigma](t) = ±4500(q - 1) (t - tl) / [tarc2 (N - 3)1/2 [Delta]] arcsec,

derived from K. Muinonen, E. Bowell, and L. H. Wasserman (Planet. Space Sci.
42, 307-313, 1994). Here, [sigma](t) is the 1-[sigma] sky-plane uncertainty,
along the line of variation, at time t; q is the perihelion distance in AU;
tf and tl are the times of the first and last observations, respectively (tf
- t and t - tl are in days); tarc and N are parameters (10) and (11) above;
and [Delta] is the Earth-asteroid distance in AU. For long-unobserved
asteroids, tf and tl may be approximated from the designation. Thus, for
1982 EE, which has a 9-day arc, tf may be taken as 1 March 1982 and tl as 15
March 1982. The formula should be accurate to within a factor of five.

*Peak ephemeris uncertaities [parameters (23) through (25)] generally occur
near opposition or conjunction (the latter are more prevalent for
Earth-crossing asteroids). The next PEU [parameter (23)] usually indicates
the best time to make astrometric observations for orbit improvement, as
will the PEU over the next 10 years [parameter (24)]. Special effort should
be made to observe asteroids whose next PEUs are the greatest during the
next 10 years [i.e., parameter (23) exceeds both parameters (24) and (25)].
Parameter (25) may be used to quantify the amount of orbital improvement
that would result from observing at or near the date of next PEU. For
example, if the next PEU is 1.2D+02 arcsec, and parameter (25) has value
6.0D+00 arcsec, a 20-fold ephemeris improvement (and approximately equal
improvement in the unceratinties of the orbital elements) could be made.
Note that numbered asteroids whose orbits are satisfactory have all three
PEUs less than about ± 2 arcsec (absolute). Consequently, numbered asteroids
whose ephemeris uncertainties, as indicated by the CEU and PEUs, at any time
exceed about 2 arcsec should be targeted for observation. Unnumbered
asteroids whose ephemeris uncertainties [as per parameter (25)] could be
brought below about ± 2 arcsec, would probably then be candidates for
numbering. A parameter (25) PEU greater than a parameter (24) PEU implies
that observing at or near the date of the next PEU [parameter (23)] may
actually cause ephemeris and orbit degradation. Thus, there is no point in
making such observations unless they are numerous and/or of high accuracy.

[_Sun]), and Vesta (1.4×10-10 M[_Sun]) were included. Planetary positions
were derived from JPL's DE403 planetary ephemeris. Positions of the three
perturbing asteroids were derived, by iteration, from our own orbits.
Relativistic effects have not been included. The orbit of one numbered
asteroid (1566 Icarus) is known to be imperfect as it requires inclusion of
relativistic effects. The orbits of other close-Sun-approaching asteroids
are doubtless similarly affected, but their observational (O-C) residuals
appear to be satisfactory.

For numbered asteroids, we have adopted a uniform policy regarding the
inclusion or exclusion of observations in the orbit determination: namely,
to exclude observations whose great-circle sky-plane residuals exceed 2.3
arcsec. (We have found from experience that, for well-determined orbits, 2.3
arcsec is an appropriate residual threshold separating "good" and "bad"
observations.) For numbered asteroids of type 2:8 in the integer-code table
above, our policy has resulted in degradation of the orbit-quality parameter
(OQP), which is a reliable (logarithmic) measure of an asteroid orbit's
quality, and which (for non-Earth approachers) correlates well with
ephemeris uncertainty. Such asteroids need orbit improvement to the point
where the exclusion of "poor" observations no longer degrades the OQP. For
unnumbered asteroids, we have retained obviously inferior observations where
doing so improved the OQP and ephemeris uncertainty, thus making it easier
to reobserve them; these asteroids are identified by integer code 2:16.

Upcoming Changes in astorb.dat Eventually, we intend to produce a version of
the database in a format resembling that espoused in our ACM93 paper [E.
Bowell, K. Muinonen, and L. H. Wasserman (1994). A public-domain asteroid
orbit database. In "Asteroids, Comets, Meteors 1993" (A. Milani et al.,
eds.), pp. 477-481. Kluwer, Dordrecht]. We will not be making this expanded
file publicly accessible until we have checked it fairly thoroughly,
incorporated it into our suite of asteroid-orbit software, and extracted
data for a paper entitled something like "Orbit and ephemeris accuracy of
multi-apparition asteroids".

In addition, we are near to making a second run on orbits for numbered
asteroids in which close asteroid-asteroid encounters will be noted and a
new perturbation scheme that includes two or three dozen asteroid perturbers
is implemented.

We are also looking into the possibility of allowing approved WWW users to
run selected programs on our system (ephemerides; which asteroids are in a
given region of sky at a given time; selecting subsets of asteroids by
orbital elements, predicted magnitude, location in the sky, etc.).

Acknowledgment and Attribution The research and computing needed to generate
astorb.dat were funded principally by NASA grant NAG5-4741, and in part by
the Lowell Observatory endowment. astorb.dat may be freely used, copied, and
transmitted provided attribution to Dr. Edward Bowell and the aforementioned
funding sources is made. Hypertext links to this WWW site are welcome.
