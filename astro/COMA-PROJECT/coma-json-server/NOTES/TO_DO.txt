1. set up ability to cross-calibrate images - eg, when we have a stack and an unshifted background stack,
   use the background stack to calibrate the stack.

  -- we have phot-calib:calibrate-image-with-image/mag-auto
             phot-calib:transfer-phot-calib-headers

2. Allow creation of background stack without subtracting it?

2a. shift-and-add should return a sky stack if asked

3. stacking with mean and median stack?
