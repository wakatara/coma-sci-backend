COMA-JSON-SERVER-DATA-DIR - directory where COMA puts working data.
  It has to be universally writable because various users might be
  using COMA.  Thus it should not have executables.

  If it is not defined, then it puts data  into the coma-json-server
  source tree as lisp-lib/astro/COMA-PROJECT/WORKING-DATA
  which is excluded from git archive.
